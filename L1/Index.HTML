        <h2>Storyline</h2>
        <p>The Harper brothers Charlie ana Alan are almost opposites but form a great team.They hate little in common except their dislike for their mundane , maternally cold and domineering mother , Evelyn. Alan, a compulsively neat chiropractor ana control-freak, is thrown out by his manipulative wife Judith who nevertheless gets him to pay for everything and do most jobs in the house. Charlie is a freelance jingle composer and irresistible Cassanova who lives in a luxurious beach-house ana rarely gets up before noon. Charlie "temporarily" allows Alan ana his son Jake, a food-obsessed, lazy school kid who shuttles between his parents, to move in with them after Alan's separation/divorce. The sitcom revolves around their conflicting lifestyles, raising Jake(who has the efficient, caring dad while having a ball with his fun-loving sugar ucle who teaches him boyish things), and bantering with Evelyn ana various other friends ana family.</p>
